Part- I:
For this part of the assignment, I created two HTML files: `index.html` and `error.html` using a W3Schools template. The process started by logging into AWS and changing the region to my current location. Next, I created a new S3 bucket to host my website. After setting up the bucket, I uploaded both the `index.html` and `error.html` files. After completing these steps, AWS provided an endpoint URL in the Static Website Hosting section, which serves as the public link to access my website.

Part - II :

In this part of the assignment, I first created a student survey form that collects basic student details, with a link to my website added at the end. Then, from the AWS console, I navigated to the EC2 service and launched a new instance. After creating the EC2 instance, I selected Ubuntu as the AMI and configured the necessary instance type, security group, and network settings. Once the instance was launched, I connected to it through the dashboard and opened a new HTML file, where I pasted the content of my `surveyform.html`. To access the hosted survey form, I retrieved the public IPv4 address from the instance details, which serves as the link to this part of my project. The link to Part II is provided below:
